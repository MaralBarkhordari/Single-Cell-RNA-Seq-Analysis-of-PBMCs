# Single-Cell-RNA-Seq-Analysis-of-PBMCs

This project uses a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from **10x Genomics**. The dataset, titled **“10k PBMCs from a Healthy Donor (v3 chemistry),”** contains gene expression data from 10,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from a healthy individual.

PBMCs are critical components of the immune system and include diverse cell types such as:

- **Lymphocytes** (T cells, B cells, and NK cells)  
- **Monocytes**  
- **Dendritic cells**

The dataset allows for:  
- Identification of distinct immune cell populations  
- Differential gene expression analysis  
- Exploration of immune responses


# Business Question

Our objective is to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data from **PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells)** to:

1. **Identify distinct cell types** within the dataset.  
2. **Understand gene expression patterns** that differentiate immune cell populations.  
3. **Explore potential biological insights**, such as:  
   - Immune response mechanisms  
   - Applications in inflammation research  
   - Advancements in regenerative medicine  
   - Insights into disease states
